# Bark

*Bark* is a mod for the VR game Gorilla Tag. It allows the player to summon a 3D interface into the game that toggles various fun/useful mechanics on and off. Because it is only enabled in modded lobbies, this mod is safe to use online.

## Features
*Bark* has various modules that can be toggled on and off, including:

### Movement
* `Airplane` - This allows the player to fly around. **Spread your arms out like and airplane** to activate and use your wrists to steer!
* `Bubble` - (Networked!) Creates a bubble around your so you can float around.
* `Grappling Hooks` - **Grab one of the grapple guns** off of your hip holster with **either grip button and then press the trigger to fire**
* `Platforms (Left/Right)` - **Press the grip button** on your controller to create a floating platform in the air that you can stand on. There's a toggle for each hand so that you can disable one if it clashes with another mod's inputs.
* `Speed Boost` - Significantly increases the player's movement speed
* `Rockets` - **Press the grip button** to spawn a rocket in each hand that boosts you around.
* `Wall Run` - Allows you to seamlessly transition between running on floors, walls, and ceilings! Push off to revert to normal movement.
* `Zipline` - **Press the grip button** to spawn a zipline launcher. **Press and release the trigger** to fire a zipline.
### Physics
* `Low Gravity` - Decreases the strength of gravity
* `No Collide` - Allows the player to fall through solid objects. Enabling this automatically enables platforms so you don't fall to your death!
* `No Slip` - Disables sliding on slippery surfaces, like ice.
* `Potions` - (Networked!) Drink potions to change your size!
* `Slippery Hands` - Makes everything slippery so you can ski anywhere!
### Teleportation
* `Checkpoint` - **Grip the left trigger** to start summoning a holographic banana above your hand. Grip the *right trigger* to warp back to it.
* `Teleport` - **Make a triangle with your thumbs and index fingers and peer through it** to initiate a teleport. Use your head to aim more finely.
### Multiplayer
* `Boxing` - Better known as "punch mod", this allows the player to be punched around by others in the lobby. You can't be punched while touching the ground.
* `Piggyback` - Allows you to ride other players! To mount someone, **have them give you two-thumbs-up**, and then **grip their shoulder**. If they **give you two thumbs down** at any point, you'll stop riding them. *Consent is important!*
* `Telekinesis` - If another player points at you with their grip button pressed, they can
  pick you up and throw you from afar.
* `X-Ray` - Allows you to see other players through walls.

These modules can be useful for exploring the game world, experimenting with gameplay mechanics, or just having fun with friends. They are **not** meant to be used to harass others, which can result in a ban from the game.

## Usage
When you join a modded lobby, simply beat on your chest like a gorilla in an alternating fashion with both hands 4 times (LRLR or RLRL). This will summon the interface in front of you. To hide the interface, simply grab it and throw it away.

## Installation
To use *Bark*, you will need to have [Monke Mod Manager](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager/releases) installed. 
Make sure to check off Utilla.
Once you have installed the mod loader, simply drop the `Bark-X.X.X.dll` file into your plugins folder.

If you have Computer Interface installed, download and install `Bark-X.X.X.CI.dll` instead.

## Important notes

While *Bark* is designed to be safe to use in modded lobbies, it is important to note that using mods in any form in public lobbies can result in a ban from the game. Use *Bark* at your own risk and only in modded lobbies.
